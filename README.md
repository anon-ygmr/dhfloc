# Exact Particle Flow Daumâ€“Huang Filters for Mobile Robot Localization in Occupancy Grid Maps

## Info

This repository contains a localization algorithm, capable of localizing a mobile robot with a differential drive on an occupancy grid map using LiDAR and odometry data.
The initial pose of the robot is assumed to be known.

This algorithm can either be used as a stand-alone python package, or inside the Robot Operating System by the wrapper provided in [this repository](https://github.com/anon-ygmr/dhfloc_ros).
